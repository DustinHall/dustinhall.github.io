# Code 102 Reading Notes

## About Me 

I am an ambitious person trying to learn as much as I can about coding to prepare myself for a career in the field. I have spent the last 15 years working in aviation, starting out as an Aviation Electrician on an anti drug detachment in the Navy, currently work as the Master Technical Training Instructor for avionics training at a private aircraft manufacturer in Georgia. Please feel free to take a look at [my projects](https://github.com/DustinHall?tab=projects).

## Growth Mindset 

To me, having a growth mindset is about keeping an open mind when faced with unanticipated difficulties. It's understanding that anything worth doing takes work and nothing goes as planned, while learning and ultimately trying to better, and get better from, every situation that comes up. A famous Henry Ford quote comes to mind:
> Whether you think you can, or you think you can't - you're right. 

Three reminders to myself that keep me in a growth mindset:
 1. Make a Concious Effort
    - Recognize areas where I can make a more concious effort to achieve my goals and avoid "gumption traps".   
 2. Stay Focused
    - Dont get tunnel vision when faced with a challenge, go for a quick walk and come back with a fresh mind.  
 3. Accept Criticism 
    - Allow myself time to review and critique my work as well as share with others and be open to their input.
