# Intro to Git

### Version Control 

* **Version Control System** - Version control tracks changes allowing you to see, and revert back to, previos versions as well as track the individuals who make them.
* **Local Version Control** - One database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.
* **Centralized Version Control** - A single server that stores all changes and file versions. Useful when working in teams.
* **Distributed Version Control** - Allows clients to create mirrored repositories. Gives more backup options than CVCS.

### What's Git?
A DVCS that creates a snapshot of the files, and stores a reference to it, when you commit (save) changes. Git relies on local operations allowing for process expediency because a projects history is stored on the local disk so it wont have to connect to servers. Git tracks all changes and detects file corruption minimizing lost data and makes it difficult for committed snapshots to be lost. There are three main stats to Git, committed; data is securely stored in local database, modified; file is changed but not committed, and staged; flagged a files changed version to be committed in the next snapshot.
