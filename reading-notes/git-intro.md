# Intro to Git

### Version Control 

* **Version Control System** - Version control tracks changes allowing you to see, and revert back to, previos versions as well as track the individuals who make them.
* **Local Version Control** - One database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.
* **Centralized Version Control** - A single server that stores all changes and file versions. Useful when working in teams.
* **Distributed Version Control** - Allows clients to create mirrored repositories. Gives more backup options than CVCS.
