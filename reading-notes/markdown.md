## Quick Markdown Summary
Markdown is a very simple, and easy to learn, language used on GitHub. It allows the user to use simple text, with some characters mixed in, to style their webpage. Markdown files will end in .md or .markdown

### Features
Some simple things that can be done in markdown include setting the size of you headings with the #. You can have up to six different sizes with one # being the largest and six #'s being the smallest, you can also make words **bold** or _italicized_. These are simple enough to do using the control(pc) or command(mac) plus b (bold) or i (italicized). If you dont want to use those shortcuts you can use ** or __ before and after a word or sentence for bold. Also, * or _ before and after a word or sentence to make it italic. **_You can also combine them as needed_**. 

Some other things that can be done using markdown include creating lists using * or numbers 
* Item 1
* - Item 1a 
* Item 2
* - Item 2a 

1. Item 1
   - Item 1a
   - Item 1b
2. Item 2
   - Item 2a
   - Item 2b

You can also create task lists with [] adding an x inbetween for completed tasks.

- [ ] Finish this section of the webpage
- [ ] Move onto next section of class
- [x] This task would be complete
