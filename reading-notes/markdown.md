## Quick Markdown Summary
Markdown is a very simple, and easy to learn, language used on GitHub. It allows the user to use simple text, with some characters mixed in, to style their webpage. Markdown files will end in .md or .markdown

### Features
Some simple things that can be done in markdown include making words **bold** or _italicized_. These are simple enough to do using the control(pc) or command(mac) plus b (bold) or i (italicized). If you dont want to use those shortcuts you can use ** or __ before and after a word or sentence for bold. Also, * or _ before and after a word or sentence to make it italic. You can also combine them as needed.
