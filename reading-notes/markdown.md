## Markdown Basics
Markdown is a very simple, and easy to learn, language used on GitHub. It allows the user to use simple text, with some characters mixed in, to style their webpage. Markdown files will end in .md or .markdown

### Features
Some simple things that can be done in markdown include setting the size of your headings using #. You can have up to six different sizes with one # being the largest and six #'s being the smallest, you can also make words **bold** or _italicized_. These are simple enough to do using the control(pc) or command(mac) plus b (bold) or i (italicized). If you dont want to use those shortcuts you can use ** or __ before and after a word or sentence for bold. Also, * or _ before and after a word or sentence to make it italic. **_You can also combine them as needed_**. 

Some other things that can be done using markdown include creating __Lists__ using `*` or numbers, indent the items by putting a `-` under the first letter of the list item above it. 
* Item 1
* - Item 1a 
* Item 2
* - Item 2a 

1. Item 1
   - Item 1a
     - Item 1b
2. Item 2
   - Item 2a
     - Item 2b

You can also create __Task Lists__ with `- []` and `[x]`  for completed tasks.

- [ ]  Finish this section of the webpage
- [ ]  Move onto next section of class
- [x]  This task would be complete 

__Tables__ are another fun item that can be created with markdown. This can be done using hyphens `-` under the headers and pipes `|` to separate the comlumns.  

Header 1 | Header 2
-------- | --------
This goes under header 1 | This goes under header 2
More words for emphasis | Still adding words here

__Links__ can be added using `[words that will be linked](actual link)`.

Please review the source of my information [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Another good [source](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for learning.

__Pictures__ can be added by dragging and dropping the file into the text editor. This will automatically format the text or you can type `![Text](url)`

__Quotes__ can be added with `>` before the quote. One of my favorite quotes from Lincoln:
> Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt.
