# Class 02 Reading Notes 
## Duckett HTML

**Chapter 2: "Text" (pp. 40-61)** 

- Structural Markup - The elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.   
- Semantic Markup - Provides extra information including emphasis in a sentence, quotes, acronyms and more.   
- Headings - Have six levels `<h1> through <h6>` with `<h1>` being a main heading with the largets font and `<h6>` being smallest and least important.   
- Paragraphs - `<p>` Consist of one or more sentences.`    
- Bold and Italic - `<b>` will make a word appear bold while `<i>` will make it italicized.    
- Superscript & Subscript - `<sup>` can be used for characters that should be superscript and `<sub>` for those that should be subscript.    
- White Space Collapsing - A browser will only show one space even if two or more are used. Coders will use this as an advantage to make code easier to follow.   
- Line Breaks and Horizontal Rules - `<br />` is used to create breaks in line. `<hr />` will create a horizontal line where it is used.     
- Visual Editors - Often resemble word processors and do differ slightly but offer features that are common to each other. They will have a code view and a visual view.   
- Semantic Markup - Examples include emphasis (italics) `<em>` blockquote `<blockquote>` to indicate that a block of text is a quotation. Strong importance (bold) `<strong>` and `<q>` for shorter quotes within text.
