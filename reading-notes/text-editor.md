## Text Editors
Text editors are critical software for web developers as they allow them to write text used to build websites. There are several different options to choose from including preloaded editors that come standard on your computer or third party editors which tend to have more features.

### Which editor is right for you?
There are several different options for text editors, and while they all get the job done there are different features across them that you want to consider when making this decision. If you prefer plain text you might just be happy with what comes loaded on your computer, be it Notepad (windows) or Text Edit (mac), these are basic editors with little to no added features. If you want features you will have to look into third party options, we will talk more about those in a minute but lets look at some popular features first.
