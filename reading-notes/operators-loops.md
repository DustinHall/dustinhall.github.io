# JavaScript Operators

An operator performs some operation on single, or multiple, operands (data value) and produces a result. There are Binary and Unary operators as well as one special ternary operator. 

**Binary**:Requires two operands one before and after the operator - operand1 operator operand2 - '3+4'.

**Unary**:Requires a single operand either before or after the operator - operator operand (or) operand operator - 'x++' or '++x'.
