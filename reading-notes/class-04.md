**Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links” (pp.74-93)**   
* Links are created using   `<a href="http://www.linkhere.com"> Linked Words Here </a>`
* Relative URLS are a shorthand way to tell the browser where a page is in relation to the current page. 
* Email - `<a href="mailto:123@ex.org"> Email Example </a>`
* To open in a new window use `target="_blank"` in the opening `<a>` tag.
* To link to a spot in the same page, give that spot an id and use the id in the href of the link. 
  * `<h1 id="top"> Top of page </h1>`
  * `<a href="#top"> To Top </a>`
* You can use the id in the reference of a link to differet page as well. `<a href="www.example.com/#id>To The ID </a>`

**Chapter 15: “Layout” (pp.358-404)**

* Key concepts in positioning elements.
  * Block level elements start on a new line while inline elements flow in between surrounding text.
  * If one block-level element is inside of another the outer block is considered the containing (or parent) element.
* Positioning schemes allow you to control the layout of a page
  * Normal flow - Every block level element appears on a new line causing each item to appear lower and lower on the page.
  * Relavitve positioning - moves an element from the position it would be in with normal flow to the top, right, bottom or left without affecting other elements.
  * Absolute positioning - positions the element in relation to its containing element. These elements move as users scroll.
  * Fixed positioning - positions element in relation to the browser window. 
  * Floating elements - allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the left or right of a containing box. 
  * When moving elements out of normal boxes can overlap. The z-index allows you to control which box appears on top. 
* Designers try to keep the width of a page between 960-1000 pixels.
  * Fixed width designs do not change sizes as the user increases or decreases their browser window. 
  * Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.
  * Grid layout examples 389-392.
